<b>Doge</b> is an Internet meme that became popular in 2013. The meme typically consists of a picture of a Shiba Inu dog accompanied by multicolored text in Comic Sans font in the foreground. The text, representing a kind of internal monologue, is deliberately written in a form of broken English.

The meme is based on a 2010 photograph, and became popular in late 2013, being named as Know Your Meme's "top meme" of that year. A
cryptocurrency based on Doge, the Dogecoin, was launched in December 2013. The Shiba Inu had a notable presence in popular culture
during late 2013. Toward the end of the decade and the beginning of the 2020s, the meme saw a resurgence in popularity due
primarily to its association with Dogecoin, which itself hit a market capitalisation of over $90 billion in May 2021. Several
online polls and media outlets recognized Doge as one of the best Internet memes of the 2010s.
